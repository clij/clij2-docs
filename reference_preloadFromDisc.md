## preloadFromDisc

This plugin takes two image filenames and loads them into RAM. The first image is returned immediately, the second image is loaded in the background and  will be returned when the plugin is called again.

 It is assumed that all images have the same size. If this is not the case, call release(image) before  getting the second image.

### Usage in ImageJ macro
```
Ext.CLIJx_preloadFromDisc(Image destination, String filename, String nextFilename, String loaderId);
```
